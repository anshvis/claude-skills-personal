# /ansh-pr-loop

**Goal:** an open PR becomes merged, parked or awaiting approval, with evidence on its head SHA.

**Uses:** [`/ansh-review`](../ansh-review/SKILL.md) (`pr` mode), [`/ansh-resolve`](../ansh-resolve/SKILL.md),
[`/ansh-verify`](../ansh-verify/SKILL.md), [`/ansh-plan`](../ansh-plan/SKILL.md),
[autonomy](../_shared/autonomy.md), [verification](../_shared/verification.md),
[stacking](../_shared/stacking.md), [worktrees](../_shared/worktrees.md),
[runtime](../_shared/runtime.md), [ledger](../_shared/ledger.md) with `_shared/ansh-log`,
[outcomes](references/outcomes.md), [comment templates](references/comments.md),
[CI triage](../ansh-resolve/references/ci-triage.md), [GitHub recipes](../ansh-resolve/references/github.md).

Arguments: `/ansh-pr-loop [<n>] [via=ansh-loop|ansh-small-loop] [reviewed]`, or
`/ansh-pr-loop stats` ([outcomes](references/outcomes.md)). Wakeups pass `reviewed` to skip step 3
when the head hasn't moved.

## Steps

1. **Identify the PR once.** Take `<n>`, or resolve it from the current branch
   (`gh pr view --json number,url,headRefName`). Name it in the first status line. Work in the
   worktree that tracks its branch ([worktrees](../_shared/worktrees.md)). Check ownership: PR
   author against `gh api user -q .login`. Not mine: read-only from here on. Run
   `/ansh-review pr <n>` and report. No pushes, comments, fixes or merges (autonomy).
2. **Pin the head.** `git fetch origin`. If `git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/<base> HEAD`
   fails, merge the base in and push per [stacking](../_shared/stacking.md). Record the head SHA.
3. **Review gate.** Run `/ansh-review pr <n>` at the pinned SHA. It reuses or reruns its lenses,
   posts the gate and merge-call comments, and returns `VERDICT`, `MERGE_LANE`, `PARKED`,
   `WAITING_ON` and the gate rows. Keep them in the state file.
4. **Fix the gate's findings.** Hand the rows the gate marks for fixing to `/ansh-resolve <n>` as
   items. Then run `/ansh-review pr <n>` again with resolve's report: it does the head bookkeeping
   and judges the fixed head, so its lane and park call reflect the fixed code.
5. **Iterate.** Each iteration:
   1. Run one `/ansh-resolve` pass on the PR. It owns CI triage, comment triage, fixes, replies,
      thread resolution and fix logging.
   2. **vitalize-agent gate.** Find `vitalize-agent[bot]`'s review whose `commit_id` equals
      `headRefOid`. None yet: not converged; arm a one-off recheck 30 minutes after the push
      (`ScheduleWakeup` 1800s, or T3 `schedule_task` on this thread) on top of the watcher. It
      left findings: `/ansh-resolve` fixes them like any review. It approved the head with no
      open findings: passed.
   3. **Stuck bot reviews.** For each bot review at `CHANGES_REQUESTED` whose findings all have a
      verified disposition, count consecutive iterations it stays stuck after the fix was pushed.
      At two, dismiss it ([GitHub recipes](../ansh-resolve/references/github.md)) and post the
      dismissal comment ([templates](references/comments.md)). Any doubt counts as not yet.
   4. **Dependencies.** For each `WAITING_ON` PR, post or edit the `waiting-on` comment and watch
      that PR too. When one merges, retarget, merge the new base, re-verify and push per
      [stacking](../_shared/stacking.md), then edit the comment.
   5. **Head moved** (a fix, a base merge, a retarget): run `/ansh-review pr <n>` at the new head
      for a fresh `VERDICT`, `MERGE_LANE` and `PARKED`.
   6. Post a short status: CI per check (CI triage format), reviews, what changed, what blocks.
6. **Parked short-circuit.** `/ansh-review` says `PARKED: yes`, or `/ansh-resolve` returns PARKED:
   finish every check that doesn't need the forbidden action, then go straight to the parked branch
   of step 8. Don't wait for a green that needs the parked step.
   **Converged when all hold on the head SHA:** every required check's build for this SHA passed;
   no review at `CHANGES_REQUESTED`; `/ansh-resolve` returned DONE with every comment traced;
   vitalize-agent passed this SHA; every gate blocker and major is fixed or has an agent default;
   no new major-or-worse finding since the gate; `/ansh-review` says `VERDICT: PASS`.
7. **Prove the head.** Run `/ansh-verify run` for the PR's packets at this exact SHA. Its
   `manifest.json` must list every check in every packet this PR covers, each passing
   ([verification](../_shared/verification.md#evidence-pack)). Any new commit, including a base
   merge, needs it again. `/ansh-verify` posts the evidence comment.
8. **Merge decision**, first match wins:
   - Not our PR: never merge, never post. Report the gate findings. Outcome `needs_review`.
   - `/ansh-correct` hardening PR (label `ansh-correct` or title prefix `ansh-correct:`): request
     Ansh as reviewer, post the comment, stop. Outcome `awaiting_approval`.
   - `PARKED: yes`, or merging would do anything on autonomy's never-do list: post the parked
     comment with the exact command or click, log `parked`, stop. Outcome `parked`.
   - `WAITING_ON` not empty: hold. Keep watching. Merge only after every dependency merged and
     the base is current ([stacking](../_shared/stacking.md)).
   - `MERGE_LANE: deep`: run `/ansh-review pr <n>` in the deep lane at the head SHA in a fresh
     subagent; it does the fresh-context review and re-runs the verification itself. Its
     `DEEP_LANE` line must read `done` and `pass`. On pass, record `deep_lane_sha` in the state
     file, post the deep-lane comment and fall through to the merge below. On fail, hand the
     blockers and majors to `/ansh-resolve` and go back to step 5. A new head clears `deep_lane_sha`.
   - Otherwise merge, pinned to the verified head: `gh pr merge <n> --squash --match-head-commit
     <sha>`. If a base-branch rule blocks a direct merge (e.g. the deploy-line-stopped ruleset), arm
     `--squash --auto --match-head-commit <sha>` so a later head can't merge unverified.
     If branch protection needs a non-author approval, request CODEOWNERS, post the
     awaiting-approval comment, arm `--auto` and keep watching. Outcome `awaiting_approval`.
9. **Log and stop.** After a merge, set `merge_state: merged` in `plan.json` and log
   `ansh-log ansh-pr-loop merge merged --pr <n> --goal <g> --milestone <M-n> --surface <s>`. Write
   one outcome line ([outcomes](references/outcomes.md)). Unwatch the PR and stop the cadence.

## Cadence

- Use the host's PR watcher when there is one (T3 `watch_pull_request`; `unwatch_pull_request`
  at the end). Arm one watcher per PR and never a second scheduler on top.
- Else use session wakeups: `ScheduleWakeup` with exactly 300 seconds and the prompt
  `/ansh-pr-loop <n> reviewed via=<via>`. While a head build is running, arm a `Monitor` on it so
  its finish wakes the loop early. Check `TaskList` first so it isn't armed twice.
- Else poll in-session every 300 seconds, waiting in chunks of at most 60 seconds, checking for
  cancellation between them.
- Persist the reviewed head, lane, stuck-bot counters, retry record and iteration count in
  `.ansh/pr-loop-<n>.json` so a fresh fire picks them up.
- Not `CronCreate`: it can't carry state between fires. Never claim a wakeup was armed when the
  host has no tool for it. Tool names here are capabilities ([runtime](../_shared/runtime.md)).

## Edge cases

| Case | Do |
|---|---|
| Another loop already watches this PR | Don't start a second. Report and stop. |
| Several stacked PRs to drive | Work the lowest unmerged PR first. Read the ones above, but don't restart its checks for them. |
| A commit the loop didn't make lands on the branch | `/ansh-review pr <n>` runs the full gate for it before any merge. |
| Auto-merge armed and a new commit is about to be pushed | `gh pr merge <n> --disable-auto` first. Re-arm only after vitalize-agent passes the new head. |
| vitalize-agent hasn't reviewed the head | Don't merge, even with CI green. GitHub's `--auto` doesn't wait for it. |
| Converged except a human `CHANGES_REQUESTED` that `/ansh-resolve` re-requested | Keep watching. Outcome `awaiting_approval`. |
| Bot review stuck but a finding lacks a verified disposition | Don't dismiss. Let another iteration pass. |
| Failure outside the PR on a required check | Keep watching. Merge the base in once the base is green. |
| A dependency is parked or awaiting approval | This PR keeps its own lane. Drive it to green and hold with the `waiting-on` comment. |
| Same check or finding fails after 3 fix rounds | Stop with each attempt's evidence. Outcome `safety_cap`. |
| 12 iterations with work left and no progress | Stop and report what blocks. Outcome `safety_cap`. Waiting on a dependency or approval doesn't count. |
| Polling fallback and the PR is only waiting (dependency, approval) | Stop with the resume command. Outcome `waiting_on_parent` or `awaiting_approval`. |
| Ansh cancels | Stop. Outcome `stopped_by_user`. |
| Ansh says merge in his own message | Merge once converged and proved. Outcome `user_asked_merge`. |

## Output

Status line each iteration, then one final block:

```
PR_LOOP: DONE | PARKED | AWAITING_APPROVAL | WAITING | NOT_OWN | BLOCKED | STOPPED
PR: #<n> <url>   HEAD: <sha>   LANE: standard | deep
OUTCOME: <outcomes.jsonl value>   WAITING_ON: [#<n>]
GATE: <worst severity>, <n fixed>, agent defaults: <D-n ...>
EVIDENCE: <evidence comment or pack path>
NEXT: <exact command or click for Ansh, or none>
```

- **DONE**: merged. **PARKED**, **AWAITING_APPROVAL**, **WAITING**: verified and held, with why.
- **NOT_OWN**: someone else's PR, findings reported.
- **BLOCKED**: a missing tool or credential, or the safety cap. Name it.
- **STOPPED**: Ansh cancelled.
