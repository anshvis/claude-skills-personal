# /ansh-plan

**Goal:** a plan any agent can execute and verify without asking me anything.

**Uses:** [autonomy](../_shared/autonomy.md), [verification](../_shared/verification.md),
[milestones](../_shared/milestones.md), [principles](../_shared/principles.md),
[ledger](../_shared/ledger.md), [memory](../_shared/memory.md) (`../_shared/ansh-memory`), [runtime](../_shared/runtime.md),
[stacking](../_shared/stacking.md), [tickets](../_shared/tickets.md), [packet template](references/packet.md),
[plan.json](references/plan-json.md), `effort-dial`, `gold-star`, `lightweight-sql`,
`/ansh-small-loop`, `/ansh-loop`.

You write no code. Plan on Astra at high effort; a Deep goal gets max. Take your time here: a
sloppy plan makes every later round more expensive.

## Steps

1. **Gather context.**
   - Linear ticket (`REV-554`, a `linear.app` URL, or a `rev-554-*` branch): fetch it and its useful
     comments. Summarize in 2-3 sentences: the need, the constraints, the edge cases it names.
     Find the TDD from links on the ticket, its parents, or the project's documents.
   - Project or several tickets: fetch each. Keep IDs, titles and statuses.
   - Prose goal: use it as is. No Linear calls.
   - Move each in-scope ticket to In Progress per [tickets](../_shared/tickets.md).
   - Read the code deeply. Fan out `Explore` subagents over the subsystems, naming conventions and
     prior art. For each area the work touches, find the existing code to mirror: the gold-star.
     You can't write a packet for code you haven't read.
   - Read project memory per [memory](../_shared/memory.md) with the goal text, then each area
     it touches. Step 5 folds what applies into the packets.

2. **Phase 0: milestones and TDD checks.**
   - With a TDD: number AC, FM, D, Q and M IDs per [milestones](../_shared/milestones.md). Find the
     `Implementation milestones` section. Draft missing blocks from `PR order`, `File blast
     radius`, `Failure modes` and `Rollout`. Keep them in `plan.md` and post them as one comment on
     the goal's own ticket, marked agent-drafted. Never edit the team's TDD doc or `spec-doc.md`.
   - No TDD: write the same blocks in `plan.md` from the ticket. A small ticket is one milestone.
   - Run every check in the milestones Phase 0 table and apply its fix.
   - List each unknown that would change the decomposition: scope edges, data-model meaning,
     user-visible behavior, migration or deploy constraints. Settle each by running something.
     Otherwise take an agent default per [autonomy](../_shared/autonomy.md) and log it
     (`agent-default`).
   - Open `plan.md` with one paragraph: how you read the goal.

3. **Goal-level criteria.** Write three distinct, itemized lists, on every plan:
   - `guardrails`: lines the work never crosses, done or not. Out-of-scope areas, security and
     compliance lines, anything the ticket says not to touch. Always add the baseline: never push
     to `main`/`master`, never track `.ansh/`, and the never-do list in autonomy.
   - `acceptance_criteria`: the AC-n list, binary, inferred ones marked. Each answers "how would a
     person check this shipped right".
   - `exit_criteria`: autonomy's stop conditions, plus anything this goal's risk adds.

   The loops' scope gate, not this step, decides which loop runs.

4. **Decompose.**
   - Cut the smallest tasks that each end in a passing check. One milestone and one PR per task.
     Order by dependency.
   - Run `effort-dial` per task (5 axes, highest wins). Stamp model and effort from runtime's model
     table. Deep means not decomposed enough: split again.
   - Stamp `fresh_eyes`: `independent` by default; `review-fresh` for auth, payments, migrations,
     destructive or data-loss work; `swarm` for a new slice, a consolidation, or a refactor over
     ~10 files.
   - Stamp `autonomy: full` on every task. Add `parked_at_merge: true` where milestones or autonomy
     say the merge is irreversible.
   - Group tasks into `prs[]`: the smallest set of tight PRs, one layer each. If the goal collapses
     to one PR, write in `plan.md` why the layers can't be cut. Several PRs use the topology in
     [stacking](../_shared/stacking.md). Record each PR's `base` there too.
   - When the goal has tickets, every code task names one. Untracked work is pure scaffolding only;
     note it in `plan.md`.
   - Name every branch and write every `prs[].links` entry per [tickets](../_shared/tickets.md), so
     no later skill has to infer them.

5. **Make each packet ready.** A task leaves the planner only when all of these hold:
   - **Files named**, with what changes in each. Find them now.
   - **Gold-star found**: a `file:line` to mirror and why. Point at the slice of a `gold-star`
     reference when the goal has one.
   - **No open questions.** Each is answered, settled by a run, or an agent default.
   - **Memory folded in**: each project memory that applies is in Watch out for or Tests to
     write, citing its id.
   - **Edge cases written** into Watch out for and Tests to write: boundaries, empty, null and
     missing inputs, concurrency and ordering, timezone and DST, pagination, permissions, partial
     failure, idempotency and retries, large inputs.
   - **Naming and tracing** for a new repo, facade, service or business-logic fn: exact tag, class
     and `Effect.fn("<Tag>.<method>")` span per method, citing STYLE.md §13,
     `services-and-layers.md` and `repo-hygiene.md`. Match the package: flat tags in legacy
     `business-logic`, `"Feature/ServiceName"` in `packages/services`. Name the sibling to copy.
   - **Verification contract** per [verification](../_shared/verification.md): surface (derived
     from the files per its surface rule), covers,
     red-first checks with why each fails today, a real answer to "could this pass while broken",
     regression from blast radius and callers, perf, evidence path.
   - **Self-contained**: a fresh agent could run it from the packet alone.

   A box that won't close means split it, research it, or take a default.

6. **Persist to `.ansh/`.** Keep it, and any other agent scratch, out of git with the local
   exclude, never the tracked `.gitignore`:
   ```bash
   grep -qxF '.ansh/' "$(git rev-parse --git-path info/exclude)" || printf '\n.ansh/\n' >> "$(git rev-parse --git-path info/exclude)"
   ```
   - `plan.md`: your reading of the goal, the problem, architecture and data flow, constraints,
     a link to `decisions.md` (D-n live there), milestone blocks, the three lists, and
     the task index with deps. Add a feature-wide edge-case analysis. Push each edge case into the
     packet that owns it; leave cross-task ones flagged here for `/ansh-review goal`.
   - `plan.json` per [the schema](references/plan-json.md).
   - `tasks/<id>.md` per [the packet template](references/packet.md).
   - `discoveries.md` (specialists append) and `decisions.md` (the decision trail in autonomy).
   - Log `plan-written`.

7. **Challenge the plan.** Get an independent read-only reviewer per runtime, in challenge mode.
   Give it `plan.md`, `plan.json` and the packets, not your reasoning. Record its provider, model
   and independence in `plan.md`. It attacks the decomposition:
   - Missing tasks: migrations, backfills, flags, rollout and rollback, telemetry, tests, docs.
   - Wrong order or hidden dependencies.
   - Edge cases the feature-wide analysis missed. This is the highest-value attack.
   - Weak verification: could each verification pass while the feature is broken? A check that
     passes today, a wrong surface, a vibe instead of a command.
   - Deep work hiding as Standard, or a task too big to run from its packet.
   - Wrong layering: business logic in a repo, raw SQL outside a repo, an unblessed pattern.

   Fold real findings in, then re-run step 5 on what you touched. Note each rejected finding and
   why in `plan.md`. A product or scope question becomes an agent default. Log `challenge-done`.

## Re-entry

A specialist never changes direction. It appends to `discoveries.md` and returns `NEEDS_REPLAN`.
Loops also send you architectural REVISE findings and tasks that hit the iteration cap.

1. Read `discoveries.md`, the packet, and project memory for the area it hit.
2. Fold what was found into `plan.md` and the affected packets.
3. Mechanical gap (a path, a gold-star, a check you can settle from code): fix the packet and
   re-stamp. Change of direction: settle it by running something, else take an agent default.
   Record either in `decisions.md`.
4. Re-split if needed. Set `status` back to `todo`. Re-run step 5 and the challenge on what changed.

## Edge cases

| case | do |
|---|---|
| Linear call fails | Note it and go on. Ticket content the plan needs is missing: BLOCKED (runtime). |
| Needed work has no ticket (ticketed goal) | Create one under the parent so every task traces to a ticket. Prose goals skip this. |
| No ACs anywhere | Infer them, mark `inferred`, list them first in the report. |
| A Q-n or reviewer question is a product call | Agent default D-n with the alternative. Never ask. |
| Irreversible rollout or data-destroying merge | `parked_at_merge: true` on the milestone, PR and tasks. |
| Perf-sensitive milestone without a budget | Default budget from verification, noted. |
| A task won't split below Deep | Stamp Astra, return DONE_WITH_CONCERNS naming it. |
| Diff will touch SQL or Drizzle | The packet tells the specialist to apply `lightweight-sql`. |
| Re-entry change of direction widens scope past the ticket | Do this ticket's share. Create a ticket for the rest. |
| Old plan lacks the three lists, milestones or Verification | Backfill them (steps 2, 3, 5), then challenge. |
| No delegation for the challenge | In-session adversarial pass, `independence: in-session`. Never call it independent. |
| Asked to run it now | Hand the plan to the loop the scope gate picks. Don't dispatch from here. |

## Output

`.ansh/plan.md`, `plan.json`, `tasks/*.md`, `discoveries.md`, `decisions.md`. Then report:
inferred ACs first, task count by tier (Deep should be zero), the challenge outcome and what it
changed, the three lists, agent defaults, parked-at-merge tasks, and the next command
(`/ansh-small-loop`, `/ansh-loop`, or `/ansh-task T1`).

Status: **DONE**, **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** (name the task that stayed Deep), or **BLOCKED** (name what's
missing).
